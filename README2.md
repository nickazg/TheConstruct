# Introducing Construct

## What
The vision of **The Construct** is to provide a platform to enable anyone to contribute, collaborate, create and grow projects in a secure, transparent decentralized environment. Ultimately enchancing project growth and adoption in a global fair market, Attracting both entrepreneurs and investors. While we primarily target the growth of startup projects, the same concepts will still translate and benifit any project at any stage.

## Why

The problem with traditional crowdfunding platforms is that they provide a great service for project-community engagement but generally only rely on donations or at best consumer pre-purchases. Thus providing little incentives for investors and ultimately limits the growth of the project. The centrilized nature of the platform and reliance on fiat currency also restricts projects to certain countries and creates unwanted fees.

On the flip side, Initial Coin offerings (ICO's) have enabled vast sums of capital to be rasied in a very short amount of time, (often in the range USD$10 million - USD$100 million). However the problem with the current state of ICO's is that they require very little true substance to raise these funds. This lack of structure attracts scammers and inherently doesnt allow enough transparency to its investors. Even if the the project is proven to be of high quality, once the ICO has ended the community has a very limited influence on the direction and pace of the project and it still largly relies on trust.

From an investors perspective





## How

**The Construct** plans to overcome these issues while also harnessing their inherit benifits by breaking down the crowd funding process into key tasks.
