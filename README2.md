# Introducing The Construct

**The Construct** provides a platform enabling anyone to contribute, collaborate, create and grow projects in a secure, transparent decentralized environment using blockchain technology. Ultimately, this enhances project growth and adoption in a global fair market, and attracts both entrepreneurs and investors unseen on any existing platforms.


While online crowdfunding platforms provide a great service for project-community engagement, the current issue is that they rely on donations or at best consumer pre-purchases. This provides little incentives for investors as they will not receive any ownership stake over the project resulting in a minimal return-on-investment (ROI). Ultimately this will limit the growth of the project, and engagement from the community. The centralized nature of the platform and reliance on a single currency also restricts projects to certain countries and creates unwanted fees.

However, Initial Coin offerings (ICO's) have enabled vast sums of capital to be raised in a very short amount of time, (often in the range USD$10 million - USD$100 million). The problem with the current state of ICO's is that they require very little true substance to raise these funds. This lack of structure attracts scammers and inherently doesn't allow enough transparency to its investors. Even if the the project is proven to be of high quality, once the ICO has ended the community has a very limited influence on the direction and pace of the project and it still largely relies on trust. It is not guaranteed that the ICO project will follow through on the delivery of their concept or product therefore leading to an element of skepticism. **The Construct** aims to alleviate this issue.


**The Construct** implements a unique funding structure, backed by blockchain technology.
The use of blockchain technology is essential, as it will allow us to work in a global, secure, transparent and trustless environment. While there will be system fees, **The Construct** core has a decentralised ownership model, meaning it can never be deleted and will always remain self sustainable. Any funds or sensitive information stored on the blockchain will have predetermined access rights, so no other entity ( including us ) can obtain this without permission.

**The Construct** implements a unique funding structure which relies on a planned project **Roadmap**, specifying the exact process the project will take to reach the proposed outcome.
A **Roadmap** will be broken down into a series of **Milestones** representing a significant task or goal which requires some sort of funding to complete, known as **Funding Stages**. A chain of alternating Milestones and Funding Stages essentially becoming the structure of the **Roadmap**.
Another exciting feature **The Construct** implements is something called **Brain Tree**, which ultimately tires to incentivise great ideas to become a reality, via a crowd funded competition. Anyone with just an idea can propose it to the global community, contributors show interest by investing into a fund and entrepreneurs/creators submit proof of work to potentially inherit the project+funds if chosen. While the original person who submitted the idea will get a portion of the winnings.
