# Introducing Construct

## What
The vision of **The Construct** is to provide a platform to enable anyone to contribute, collaborate, create and grow projects in a secure, transparent decentralized environment. Ultimately enchancing project growth and adoption in a global fair market, Attracting both entrepreneurs and investors unseen on any exsiting platforms. While we primarily target the growth of startup projects, the same concepts will still translate and benifit any project at any stage.

## Why

The problem with online crowdfunding platforms is that they provide a great service for project-community engagement but generally only rely on donations or at best consumer pre-purchases. Thus providing little incentives for investors and ultimately limits the growth of the project. The centrilized nature of the platform and reliance on fiat currency also restricts projects to certain countries and creates unwanted fees.

On the flip side, Initial Coin offerings (ICO's) have enabled vast sums of capital to be rasied in a very short amount of time, (often in the range USD$10 million - USD$100 million). However the problem with the current state of ICO's is that they require very little true substance to raise these funds. This lack of structure attracts scammers and inherently doesnt allow enough transparency to its investors. Even if the the project is proven to be of high quality, once the ICO has ended the community has a very limited influence on the direction and pace of the project and it still largly relies on trust.


From an entrepreneurial perspective, 

From an investors perspective





## How

**The Construct** plans to overcome these issues while also harnessing their inherit benifits by implimenting a unique funding structure, backed by blockchain technology. 

The use of blockchain techology is essential, as it will allow us to work in a global, secure, transparent and trustless environment. While there will be system fees, **The Construct** core is not owned by anyone, meaning it can never be deleted and will always remain self sustainable. Any funds or sensitive information stored on the blockchain will have predetermined access rights, so no other entitiy ( including us ) can obtain this without permission.

**The Construct** impliments a unique funding structure which relies on a planned project **Roadmap**, specifying the exact process the project will take to reach the proposed outcome. 

A **Roadmap** will be broken down into a series of **Milestones** representing a significant task or goal which requires some sort of funding to complete, known as **Funding Stages**. A chain of alternating Milestones and Funding Stages essentially becoming the structure of the Roadmap.

Another exciting feature **The Construct** impliments is something called **Lightblub**, which ultimately tires to incentivise great ideas to become a reality, via a crowd funded competition. Anyone with just an idea can propose it to the global commuinty, contributors show interest by investing into a fund and entrepreneurs/creators submit proof of work to potentially inherit the project+funds if chosen. While the original person who submitted the idea will get a portion of the winnings.
